    <ul>
        <li><strong>Think before you share:</strong> Try not to post things like your address, phone number, or other private stuff.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a strong password:</strong> A longer password with symbols and numbers is harder to guess.</li>
        <li><strong>Be careful with links:</strong> If a link looks weird or unexpected, it’s best not to click it.</li>
        <li><strong>Check your privacy settings:</strong> Make sure only the right people can see your posts and info.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep your apps updated:</strong> Updates help fix bugs and protect your account.</li>
        <li><strong>Limit who can access your account:</strong> Only share login info if you really need to (and only with people you trust).</li>
        <li><strong>Watch your account activity:</strong> Keep an eye on logins or messages that don’t seem like they came from you.</li>
        <li><strong>Look out for scams:</strong> Don’t fall for messages offering free money or fake giveaways.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t overshare:</strong> It’s okay to keep some things private — not everything needs to be posted.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a VPN if you can:</strong> It helps keep your internet connection more private and secure.</li>
    </ul>
